## Info

I am not making documentation for this because it mainly designed for the guild Felony. If you want to use it, you can, but you will have to make your own config file and change the code to fit your needs.
I suggest if your looking for a bridge bot, to use [Hypixel Guild Chat Bridge](https://github.com/DuckySoLucky/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge) by DuckySoLucky and myself. It is a lot more customizable and has a almost all the same commands and stuff.
If you do need support message me on discord via [Kathund#2004](https://discord.com/users/608584543506530314)

## Original Code 
- This project was originally made by DuckySoLucky
- I was lazy so make me own like i was doing before
- Go use his and not mine coz mines designed for the Felony Guild
